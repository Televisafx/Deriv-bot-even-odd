# Deriv-bot-even-odd
I have this bot which trades differs when a double gits appeares . for example 101 the bot will trade differs 0. 868 the bot will trade differs 6. but for me i change the bot to trade on odd so when the pairing digits appear it trades odd after one tick. have tested the bot on various valatilities and have seen the loosing streak is 8 and was asking any developer help delop a pairing digit bot that trades only odd whenever a pairing digits appear combine with virtual hook with prompt to choose the number of virtual losses before execution of a real trade.
